Outcomes: 
  1. Standing differences in hydraulic conductivity between Aspens was directly related to tree mortality up to seven years post drought.
  2. Xylem tension between healthy and dying aspens was not found to be significantly different, thus standing differences in hydraulic        conductivity were not caused by differential water stress in healthy vs. dying individuals.
  3. Xylem vessel growth was not found to be significantly reduced in dying individuals compared to healthy ones, and growth rings post-        drought were of similar size in dying and healthy aspens five years after maximum drought intensity. Thus, drought-induced growth          legacy was not to blame for standing hydraulic differences.
